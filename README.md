# 🧠 On-Chain Case Studies Vault

Welcome to my personal vault of blockchain case studies — focused on **security**, **anaalysis**, and **research**.

This repo is designed to show:
- Hands-on experience with tools like **Etherscan**, **on-chain proxies**, and **security tools**
- Hands-on interaction with smart contracts, tracing wallet activity, & exploring protocol infrastructure directly on-chain
- My journey from DeFi user to technically fluent blockchain analyst

## 🔍 Featured Case Studies

### 📁 [`GRT_Unstaking`](./GRT_Unstaking)
> Recovered a deprecated GRT delegation from The Graph's Ethereum staking contract.  
> Practiced unstaking via Etherscan, gas cost analysis, wei conversion, and proxy contract exploration.

**Key Skills:**  
`Etherscan`, `staking`, `delegation shares`, `gas estimation`, `Ethereum`, `contract abstraction`
